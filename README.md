Installing Ubuntu on a MacBook Using UTM

To install Ubuntu on my MacBook using UTM, an application for creating and managing virtual machines, I followed these steps:

1. Install UTM
   - I started by downloading and installing the UTM application from its official website. UTM is a powerful tool for managing virtual machines on macOS and allows me to run different operating systems in a virtual environment.

2. Download the Ubuntu Image
   - Next, I went to the official Ubuntu website and downloaded the Ubuntu ISO image. I selected the version that best suited my needs, ensuring it was compatible with the version supported by UTM.
3. Create a New Virtual Machine
   - I opened the UTM application and began creating a new virtual machine. I chose the appropriate settings based on my system architecture (x86_64 or ARM64) and selected "Linux" as the operating system, using the ISO image I had downloaded. I allocated suitable resources to the virtual machine, such as memory and storage.

4. Install Ubuntu
   - After setting up the virtual machine, I started it and followed the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu from the ISO image. I completed the installation process and rebooted the virtual machine once the installation was finished.

5. Install ROS on Ubuntu
   - Once Ubuntu was up and running inside the virtual machine, I configured the necessary ROS sources and followed the installation steps for ROS. This included updating the package list and installing ROS from the official sources. I ensured that the ROS environment was properly configured so that all tools and packages functioned correctly.

6. Verify Installation
   - To confirm that ROS was installed correctly, I ran ROS core, which is the essential component of the ROS system.
By following these steps, I successfully installed Ubuntu on my MacBook using UTM to run Ubuntu as a virtual machine. This approach provided a flexible and isolated environment for testing and developing ROS applications on my MacBook.
